  <h1 style="color:#060b30;">Jupiter’s Moons: A Diverse Family</h1><br/>
  <p>Jupiter’s moons are a fascinating group of celestial bodies that offer insights into the planet’s formation and the dynamic nature of the solar system. The four largest moons—Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto—are known as the Galilean moons, named after Galileo Galilei, who first observed them. Each moon is unique: Io is the most volcanically active body in the solar system, Europa may harbor an ocean beneath its icy surface, Ganymede is the largest moon and has a magnetic field, and Callisto’s heavily cratered surface suggests it has remained relatively unchanged for billions of years. These moons remain a primary focus of scientific exploration.</p>
