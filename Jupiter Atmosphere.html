<H1 style="color:#060b30;">Jupiter’s Atmosphere: A Mystery of Gas and Storms</H1><br/>
<P>Jupiter’s atmosphere is a captivating and complex layer of gases that creates extreme weather patterns. Made mostly of hydrogen and helium, the atmosphere contains traces of methane, ammonia, and water vapor. The planet is known for its strong winds and massive storms, including the Great Red Spot, which is a giant storm larger than Earth that has been observed for over 350 years. The atmosphere is divided into multiple layers, and the extreme temperatures and pressures make it difficult for scientists to fully understand. Nonetheless, studying Jupiter's atmosphere provides valuable information about the gas giants in our solar system and their potential for supporting life.</P>
